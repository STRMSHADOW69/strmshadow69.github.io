## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on building a **machine learning–based diabetes prediction system** using real-world clinical data from the **National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)**. The objective is to analyze key health indicators and accurately classify individuals as diabetic or non-diabetic using supervised learning techniques.

The project demonstrates an **end-to-end healthcare analytics pipeline**, from raw data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to model comparison, evaluation, and interpretation.
